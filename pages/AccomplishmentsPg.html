    <h5>I’m not proud of everything I've done by a long shot, but there are things I’ve done that no matter what the
        situation or audience I will always be very proud of myself for, such as conquering my anger, it took a very
        slow and calculated approach but after years, I can finally say that I reasonably have my anger in check, I
        passed the A.R.T. class thats for people to get thier anger in check but i had already gotten a hold of my anger
        by then. I’ve also passed the ServSafe food handlers test and got certified and I will be certified until 2026.
        It also took a bit of work to get from where I was, to being able to attend Codestack as well, so I am very
        proud to call myself a student of Codestack.

    <h5>
        I want to learn how to code and script because there’s a decent amount of money in it but also because i love
        games and my dream since I was old enough to think about it fully has always been to become a game developer to
        make games that I like because the specific games I like can be hard to find.

    <h5>
        I’m still working hard to keep myself motivated and manage my stress, I’ve been battling my mental health for as
        far as I can remember. My normal way of coping is very unhealthy and I still tend to over look my mental
        readiness and state before acting and end up just dealing with whatever is bothering me until it drives me
        insane. So I’ve been trying to do things to eliminate those scenarios.
