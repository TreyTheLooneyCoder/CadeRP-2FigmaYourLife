        I love to game, I started gaming at the young age of around 3 to 4 with an old GameCube and some old RCA TV
        games. I played a lot of the Power Rangers SPD RCA Tv game and MarioKart with my mom. Gaming is really the main
        thing you’ll see at the center of my being, but I do also have a lot of pieces to my personality, like something
        people dont guess about me based of looks is that I love reading, a good fantasy or dystopian novel can almost
        dictate my entire mood for the rest of the week, and my love for fitness was taught to me at the age of 7 when I
        began practicing martial arts, I love to work up a sweat and getting that sore feeling when you know you worked
        your muscles out well. I’ve always loved music and I did choir for around a year when I was 7 for church, at the
        age of 16 almost 17 is when I first started rapping around friends as a joke, then about a year ago when I
        turned 18 i started rapping more frequently because people liked my lyrics and my flow.
