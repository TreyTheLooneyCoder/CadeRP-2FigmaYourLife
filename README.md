Figma has to be approved before you can start with your coding 
Late Assignments will automatically get a Zero Regardless of the Price of Tea in China. 

Peer Review: David M.
"Great color scheme for the wedbsite. The navbar works as intended.
Cool use of the dropdown menu. The offcanvas effect is also very cool and works well.
It could have also been a carousel, since it is just images, but the off canvas
feature might actually be better since it should work for mobile devices too.
Since you have the images left justified you could maybe try adding text 
to the side of the pictures next time instead of underneath. You could also add
some content to your landing page too, since it is a little plain."
